    <h2 style="background-color: white;">What is Stress?</h2>
    <p class="main">&nbsp;&nbsp; Stress is a natural human reaction that
      everyone experiences. In truth, the human body is built to experience and
      respond to stress. When you face changes or challenges, your body responds
      physically and mentally. That's called stress. Stress reactions can assist
      your body in adapting to new surroundings. Stress may be beneficial in
      that it keeps us attentive, focused, and ready to avert danger. If you
      have an important test coming up, for example, a stress reaction may help
      your body function harder and remain awake longer. However, stress becomes
      an issue when they persist without release or moments of rest.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Higher education at colleges and universities is now more
        complex than ever before. Today's college students are confronted with
        several big issues and problems during their academic studies. As a
        result, most college students appear worried. According to experts,
        reasonable stress is a typical aspect of college students' lives. Many
        students stay away from home, friends, and families for the first time.
        In addition, students are responsible for performing well in their
        advanced academic courses. Some may believe that college students are
        not stressed. They believe that all a student needs to do is show up to
        class, pass a few examinations, and graduate. This is not the case.
        College students' stress may be tremendous, affecting many aspects of
        their lives. There is some stress in college studentâ€™s life: </p>
      <h4>Monetary burden</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higher education at institutions is not inexpensive,
        and not everyone can afford it. It makes no difference whether you
        attend a public or private institution. College fees in both sorts of
        colleges are gradually growing. In addition, if you live outside of your
        city, then tally up the costs of your college tuition, books or copies,
        and room rent; you might be shocked. As a result, students are
        embarrassed to borrow money from their parents for a variety of reasons.
        As a result, many students are concerned about how they will handle
        their financial obligations.</p>

    </style>
      <h5>Unhealthy Rivalry</h5>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Competition is beneficial to everyone in all aspects of
        life. However, when unhealthy rivalry occurs, it is a highly dangerous
        and stressful condition for an individual. Today, students' academic
        marks are entirely dependent on their performance in various class
        examinations and tasks assigned by professors. Students already have a
        lot on their plates with schoolwork and other responsibilities. At the
        same time, they must complete those assignments within the short
        deadlines. However, they are unable to do both academic objectives
        satisfactorily. As a result of such excessive academic competitiveness,
        most students get anxious.</p>

      <h6>Expectations of Parents</h6>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So many parents constantly put pressure on their children
        to do what their parents desire. Such parents don't even bother to find
        out what their children are interested in or what their children's
        strengths and aptitudes are. As a result, children are continually under
        pressure to succeed in order to meet their parents' expectations.
        Sometimes the weight of parental expectations becomes the primary source
        of stress for students. Even this tension frequently leads to
        melancholy, difficult situations, and, sadly and suicide.</p>

              Ways to Manage Stress</span></b></a></h8> <br>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; High school students must compete fiercely to succeed in
        demanding classes, spectacular extracurricular activities, studying for
        and passing college placement exams, and making significant and
        life-altering decisions about their future. They must also handle the
        social difficulties that come with being in high school. This makes many
        students feel stress and desire to release stress, but with all of the
        obligations and commitments that occupy a student's calendar, it can be
        challenging to find the time to experiment with novel stress-relieving
        techniques. There are some ways to manage stress: </p>

    }
    </style> <br>
      <h9 class="s3"><b>Practice deep breathing</b></h9>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduce sympathetic nervous
        system activity, which governs the body's reaction to a perceived
        threat, by engaging in deep breathing. Your parasympathetic nervous
        system can be activated by taking deep breaths that are inhaled on a
        count of five, held for two seconds, and then exhaled on a count of
        five. This can help you feel less stressed and anxious overall.</p>

      <h10><b>Listen to music</b></h10>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Music is a useful stress reliever that has numerous
        cognitive advantages. Depending on the situation, it can either help you
        relax or excite your mind. Students can benefit from music by listening
        to classical music as they study, lively music to "wake up" their minds,
        or their favorite soft melodies to unwind. </p>

      <h11><b>Connect with others</b></h11>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Humans are social beings. You need to have connections
        with others in order to feel supported. Finding a sense of community is
        important to your well-being. Joining in an activity together can
        provide you with support and create lasting relationships that can be
        supportive in difficult times.</p>

      <h12><b>Exercise</b></h12>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Regular exercise can help reduce stress. It helps your
        body produce endorphins that make you feel good. A 30-minute walk daily
        can help reduce stress levels, but intensive exercise is recommended.
        Even if you don't feel like it, you'll feel better after.</p>
